title: Open Rocker Switch
description: The Open Rocker Switch is an inexpensive 3D printable accessibility switch.
  The switch consists of two separate buttons that are activated by pressing on
  either side. The switch is 167 mm L x 79 mm W x 16 mm H and uses two standard
  mono 3.5 mm cables. Using the model of tactile switch specified, the
  activation force is about 1.3 N (130 gf) for each side. This switch is
  comparable in size, activation force, and travel to the discontinued AbleNet
  Rocker Switch. The Open Rocker Switch has interchangeable button pieces and
  center divider pieces for users to customize and personalize their switch.
intended-use: This switch is intended for use by people with disabilities who may not have
  the dexterity or strength to utilize standard input devices. This switch may
  be used for computer access, alternative and augmentative communication,
  adaptive gaming, or playing with switch adapted toys.
