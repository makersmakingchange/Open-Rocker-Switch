<!--- Open Source Assistive Technology: GitHub Readme Template Version 1.2 (2024-May-27)  --->

<!---
This is a GitHub repository intended to act as a template for an open source assistive technology device. It is meant to contain all design files, build files, and documentation for the project. More information about how to use the template is available in the [Documentation_Guide](/Documentation_Guide.docx). You can see examples of other Open AT Devices at the Makers Making Change [website](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/category/assistive-devices).

<!--- TITLE --->
# Open Rocker Switch
<!--- Should match the name of the GitHub repository. Choose something descriptive rather than whimsical.  --->

## Overview
<!--- A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs. --->
The Open Rocker Switch is an inexpensive 3D printable accessibility switch. The switch consists of two separate buttons that are activated by pressing on either side. This switch is comparable in size, activation force, and travel to the discontinued AbleNet Rocker Switch. The Open Rocker Switch has interchangeable button pieces and center divider pieces for users to customize and personalize their switch.

<MODIFY LINE AS NECESSARY> The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. 

The Open Rocker Switch is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

The overall cost of materials is about $7 (plus $8 for component shipping).
