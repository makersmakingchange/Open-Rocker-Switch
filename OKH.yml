title: Open Rocker Switch
description: The Open Rocker Switch is an inexpensive 3D printable accessibility switch.
  The switch consists of two separate buttons that are activated by pressing on
  either side. The switch is 167 mm L x 79 mm W x 16 mm H and uses two standard
  mono 3.5 mm cables. Using the model of tactile switch specified, the
  activation force is about 1.3 N (130 gf) for each side. This switch is
  comparable in size, activation force, and travel to the discontinued AbleNet
  Rocker Switch. The Open Rocker Switch has interchangeable button pieces and
  center divider pieces for users to customize and personalize their switch.
intended-use: This device is designed for users of accessible switches, particularly those
  using devices that require dual inputs, such as scanning devices or Morse code
  input.
